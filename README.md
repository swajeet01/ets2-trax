# ETS2Trax
An application to categorize and manage music tracks for Euro Truck
Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.

## What do you mean?
If you play ETS2/ATS and use the radio (local music not radio
stream) to listen to your favorite music on your drive and you
like to listen to various tracks based on your mood, you might
have struggled with copying and moving music files from your game
directory. Well it's okay for few tracks but if you have more than
10 playlist it might get boring to copy or move files again and again.
This application makes it easier for you to do that, it lets you
create CDs (playlists, not real CDs xp) and add your tracks to it and
insert one CD at a time so all the tracks from it can be played on truck
radio.

## Usage
- Launch the application.
- Click Load and select you ETS2/ATS data directory. (where the
ETS2/ATS music, profiles folders are, generally in Documents.)
- Click Select CD, enter the name of the new CD then click Create,
or select a CD from list if created previously then click Select, click
delete after selecting a CD from list to delete it.
- Add or remove tracks from selected CD.
- Click Insert to put all tracks of Selected CD in your music directory
